# Cognito Deck üÉè

Cognito Deck is an open-source, Android-based smart flashcard application designed for language learners. It aims to bridge the gap between knowing a word and using it in context.

This project is currently in its early development stages.

## ‚ú® The Core Problem & Our Solution

Many language learners face a frustrating problem: they can memorize hundreds of flashcards, but struggle to actually *use* the words in real sentences. You can recognize a word, but you can't apply it. This is the gap between **passive recognition** and **active use**.

Cognito Deck is designed to solve this exact problem.

Our core philosophy is to force active recall and contextual application. We do this through two key pillars:

1.  **You Control What You Learn:** Start immediately by importing vocabulary from our pre-populated library (e.g., JLPT levels), or create your own custom topics. Your learning path is 100% relevant to you.

2.  **The Automatic Quiz Engine (The Killer Feature):** This is what makes Cognito Deck different. Instead of just showing you the same card over and over, the app will take the vocabulary you are currently studying and **automatically generate a variety of contextual exercises**.
    *   Fill-in-the-blanks
    *   Multiple Choice questions
    *   Sentence Ordering puzzles
    *   And many more

    By completing these exercises, you are forced to actively use the words in different situations, which dramatically improves retention and your ability to use the language in the real world. This turns passive memorization into active, applied learning.
